# Eastmile Python Updater
  First of all, use ``pip install requests tqdm``

## Why i maked it?
  Just because my brother play it on my linux computer and the animated background dont work on wine and it crash, so for have it updated, i just make it easy on python

## Why is so slow for check the files?
  I know that is better compare the online json with one local json with the local files values, but i make it fast and i want so play valorant rn, so in anyother moment i will update it.

## How to play Eastmile on linux?
  Download the updater.py, download wine and wine-config (config wine as win8 or newest) and execute the updater.py. It will go to download all the files and execute the game. Also, ingame u need to rebind all the controls (the F-X keybinds cant be rebinded, as F1, F2...)

Do a pull request if u want make changes ^^
